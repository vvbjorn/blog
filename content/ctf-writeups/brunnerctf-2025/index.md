Get ready all cyber chefs and code connoisseurs, Brunnerne has cooked up their very first BrunnerCTF for all of you to enjoy!

We have prepared a fresh batch of delicious challenges with all your favorite flavors: Web, forensics, rev, crypto, pwn, OSINT - but perhaps also a few secret ingredients to surprise your palette!

The CTF is aimed mostly at home cooks with a bit of experience, but we have something for every taste: From an entire "Shake & Bake" category for those most comfortable sticking to instant noodles to a few chef"s specials that will challenge even the most experienced Masterchefs.
